**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In the farmers market model, to guarantee the appropriate and ethical use of information, certain ethical rules must be followed while querying data from the farmers market model. These rules provide a framework for carrying out data analysis in a way that protects people's privacy, encourages equity, and maintains stakeholders' and customers' confidence.

As I keep working with the farmers market data, I'm aware of the need to adjust my approach to focus more on protecting privacy and being transparent, even though I'm already following these principles. To protect privacy better, I'd carefully check if I really need personal information for each query, making sure I only use it when absolutely necessary. I'd also look for ways to collect and keep sensitive data even less, maybe by having stricter rules about how long we keep data or by using more advanced techniques to hide people's identities.

For transparency and accountability, I'd make sure to document exactly why I'm doing each query and what I'm trying to find out. This way, everyone can see why I'm doing what I'm doing and know that I'm thinking about ethics. I'd also make sure to check myself regularly to make sure I'm doing everything right and ask my colleagues or bosses for feedback to make sure I'm following ethical rules. By always trying to do better in these areas, I can make sure I'm doing my best to follow ethical rules when working with the farmers market data.
